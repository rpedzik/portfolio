                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph" align = "justify">I worked with graphical design and promotional ad work throughout my time as a creator and producer for various independent clients such as musical artists, businesses, and even schools. I have marketed my work to be available to large audiences and be accessible by most and I strive to make my products and designs as accessible as possible. I have created album art for artists, logos/promotional material for business, and a website with all coordinating photographic/design material required to flesh out the site. I believe that my certifications in bothe Adobe Illustratir and Photoshop have allowed me to maintain a steady, strong, and prominent work ethic that is notable in those that see my various works.</p>

                                   <p class="post-open-paragraph" align = "justify">I won this award from my outstanding effort throughout highschool to achieve an above the average work ethic in the program. I created a variety of videos from PSAâ€™s, Commercials, News Stories, to Monthly shows, Feature Stories, Promotional ad material for Circus Circus, etc. In my senior year of highschool I created 72 projects throughout the 4 quarters which totaled above the previous record and placed me as the one creating the most projects. I learned a lot of experience putting in the effort to achieve this award from various productions taught me how to have a good work ethic, stay on task, and meet real quotas with consistent quality. From this I ended up getting a scholarship out of the work I put in during my schooling.</p>
